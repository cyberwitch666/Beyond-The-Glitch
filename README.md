# Beyond the Glitch
This project is an updated website, collection of thoughts, images and proposals furthering on an idea I proposed last year while at The School for Poetic Computation, that the GAZE MAKES THE GLITCH. This website was created as a final project for Brigid Cohen's "Music, Power, Mobility, and Worldhood" class taught in the Music Department at NYU.

This project is a work in progress. Currently, I need to:
* add additional information
* update with resources for further reading
* add hyperlinks
* copyedit
* make responsive for mobile

## built with
* atom editor
* github
* figma
