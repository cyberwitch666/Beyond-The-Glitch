# Beyond the Glitch
This project is an updated website, collection of thoughts, images and proposals furthering on an idea I proposed last year while at The School for Poetic Computation, that the GAZE MAKES THE GLITCH. This website was created as a final project for Brigid Cohen's "Music, Power, Mobility, and Worldhood" class taught in the Music Department at NYU.
