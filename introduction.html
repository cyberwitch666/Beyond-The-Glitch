    <p>On May 8 I tweeted &quot;How long will my black body be watched / consumed / retweeted after I die?&quot;</p>
    <img src="images/tweet1.png" alt="screenshot of tweet from May 8th" width="500">

    <p>This question was hinting at a certain anxiety around my imagery and its relation to death, particularly, due to the numerous amounts of black death imagery that was circulating on every social media feed I was on. </p>

    <p><i>Seeing is believing, they say.<br>
      And even then...</i></p>

    <p>In January 2020, I participated in The School for Poetic Computation's Code Society program and took a class called &quot;The Fuzzy Edges of Character Encoding&quot; taught by Everest Pipkin, a drawing, game, and software artist. There I was exposed to the history of how computers communicate and how we communicate through computers to each other? But what really stood out to me was the fact that everything on the computer is connected to a set of numbers, even these words on your screen right now. Even the images. Even the images of black death.</p>

    <p><b>Data Bending</b> is the process where you upload one file in a program that was designed to open another kind of file. An example of this would be opening a MP3 file in Photoshop, a program meant for images. </p>

    <p>What then kind of file is the body? What kind of file am I? </p>

    <p>It feels like any attempt to upload myself would result in databending.</p>

    <p>What is the difference between me and a computer?</p>
    <img src="images/computer1.jpg" alt="human in circle, computer in circle">

    <p>My general approach to a question is to explore the possibilities of an answer through art, software, movement, writing, conversation, or whatever seems fit for the question. For these questions above, I decided to move through the process of data-bending using an image of myself.</p>

    <p>To begin, I opened a selfie of myself in a hex editor, an editor that allows you to see the binary data of a file, to experience the process of looking and truly seeing my guts - a conglomeration of numbers and symbols.</p>

    <p>Technically, we are seeing both the binary and ASCII representation of each of the bytes on the right-hand side. </p>

    <p>**ASCII = American Standard Code for Information Interchange**<br>
      What's the American Standard Code for blackness?</p>
    <p>The thing about an editor, is that it allows you to edit, to add, to subtract, and to save the changes that are made. So I did just that with the code. With each edit, I saved the file and re-opened the image on my desktop to see the results of the change. I did this process over and over until I could not recognize myself anymore.</p>
    <img src="images/glitch1.png" alt="glitched selfies of me" width="500">

    <p>This process produced a glitch.</p>

    <p>Eventually I glitched the file to the point of it not being able to open. </p>

    <p>To the point of death.</p>

    <h3>GLITCH GLITCH GLITCH</h3>
    <img src="images/glitch2.png" alt="glitched definition" width="500">

    <p>((Interestingly enough, when I took a screenshot of this, my computer would not stop making the camera shutter noise to the point where it was on loop repeatedly until I turned my computer off. A literal glitch.))</p>

    <p>Although this data-bending exercise was a digital exercise with no real consequences, the results feel painfully familiar. </p>

    <p>What does the everyday glitching process look like? And what I mean is not a glitch in the system such as a tiny inconvenience or tiny error but rather what does the process of adding and removing code to the point of rendering some bodies fully seen and visible and others invisible or visible but legible look like in the everyday?</p>

    <p>In &quot;Captivating Technology,&quot; Ruha Benjamin states &quot;A key feature of this work is the understanding that racialized groups are not only the objects of harm and neglect, but that the meaning and power of racial hierarchies are enacted through technoscientific processes,&quot; (9). Technology functions by organizing and it organizes by including and by including it can control aspects of visibility.</p>

        <div class="sticky-test">
          <p class="subsection" id="section-two">LIFE/DEATH</p>
          <hr class="big-1">
        </div>

    <p>I made this website simply because I care and it is a matter of life or death. The glitch has consequences. It is the gap between worlds that may result in the negation of worlds. It is the gap between my black vibrant life and your gaze upon my blackness that triggers your death drive.</p>

    <p><i>We know about the glitch.</i></p>

    <p>It’s in the algorithms used to determines the trajectory of a life and the likelihood that someone is supposedly a criminal. Like a magical slight-of-hand trick, humans avoid accountability but embedded the racism into numbers and machines. Playing dumb as if we can’t tell who trained them.</p>

    <p><i>We know about the glitch.</i></p>

    <p>It’s in the destroyed archives and records so that I may not find my way back to ancestral technologies. So that, I may be stuck in the colonial linear time, a time systems that mandates I both forget and cannot move forward.</p>

    <p><i>We know about the glitch.</i></p>

    <p>It’s in the epigenetic trauma that resides in my body that I now must dedicate a lifetime to heal. It’s in my corporeal data that remembers every time someone made me feel unworthy, ugly, disposable, worthless, dead. All lies that I have been made to keep. All lies that I no longer want to hold.</p>

    <p>For so long, I have been disinterested in proposing any form of solutions and have been disinterested in entertaining any proposed ones, partially because the ones that are often recommended are technofixes (technofixes with anti-blackness embedded in the hardware and software).We should know by now cannot save us.</p>

    <p> But perhaps magic can.</p>
